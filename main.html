      <p>Founded in 1916, BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke) began as a manufacturer of aircraft engines before pivoting to motorcycles in 1923 and then
         automobiles in 1928 with the BMW 3/15. Renowned for its commitment to performance and luxury, BMW became iconic with models like the 328 sports car 
         and the 2002. The brand's slogan, "The Ultimate Driving Machine," 
        encapsulates its legacy of engineering excellence. Today, BMW continues to innovate, leading the way in electric mobility with its i series while 
        remaining a symbol of quality and driving pleasure.</p>
